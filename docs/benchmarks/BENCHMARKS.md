## 0. FULL CORPUS INGEST — production scale (measured 2026-07-13)

End-to-end run of the whole cleaned engineering corpus through the
`sliding_window` pipeline (GLiNER entities + Gemma-4-E2B QAT relations,
`--reasoning off`), project-local `./data/test-docs`, via `run_sync_loop.sh`.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Documents ingested** | **283** (100% of cleaned corpus) |
| **Corpus size on disk** | 161 MB |
| **Entities in Neo4j** | **894** |
| **Typed edges in Neo4j** | **971** |
| **Vector chunks in Qdrant** | **82,237** (dim 1024, jina-v3) |
| **Avg throughput** | ~9.0 s/doc |
| **Extraction mode** | `sliding_window` (GLiNER + E2B QAT) |
| **Domain** | engineering (single) |

**Edge-type distribution (all 6 schema types populated):**

| Relation | Count |
|----------|-------|
| REFERENCES | 302 |
| DEPENDS_ON | 293 |
| IMPACTS | 202 |
| FIXES | 83 |
| AUTHORED | 82 |
| REVIEWED | 9 |

**Top entity types:** API 127, Framework 74, Bug 60, Database 59, Developer 58,
Component 47, Metric 43.

**`/ask` retrieval (verified, `synthesize:false`):** hybrid path returns
10 Qdrant + 10–11 graph hits across diverse queries (incident root-cause,
settlement process, runbook, PR authorship, architecture). Graph traversal
correctly links incident entities (e.g. `Cassandra` → `ALLOW FILTERING` →
`nodetool repair` → `INC-2026-01-30`). With `synthesize:true`, E4B (QAT,
`--reasoning off`) writes grounded answers with `[N]` citations.

Reliability fixes landed for this run: GLiNER made thread-safe (lock) and
crash-tolerant (predict wrapped in try/except → empty instead of HTTP 500),
`write_graph` persists on the success path for all extraction modes, and
`.syncignore` excludes non-text noise (`.class/.jar/.jpeg/.java/.py/.txt`,
`IMPORT_*.md`) + the sync bookkeeping files.

## 1. EXTRACTION MODE COMPARISON (primary decision)

| Metric | Qwen Index-Routing | E2B llm Mode (current) | Verdict |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Extraction model** | Qwen2.5-1.5B Q4_K_M | Gemma-4-E2B Q4_0 | E2B 6× larger |
| **Entities detected** | 9 (GLiNER) | E2B decides | — |
| **Distinct edges written** | ~5 | **9** | E2B |
| **Relationship types covered** | 3 of 6 | **6 of 6** | E2B |
| **Edge precision (vs gold)** | **~20%** | **89%** | E2B 4.5× better |
| **Recall** | Low | **Good** | E2B |
| **ASSOCIATED_WITH fallback** | N/A | 1 of 9 edges | acceptable |
| **Extraction latency** | **1.2s** | 11.8s | Qwen 10× faster |
| **Total ingest (extract+embed+write)** | ~fast | **13.3s** | Qwen |

## 1.1 Hybrid Mode (WS1 — GLiNER + E2B, NEW)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Entities detected** | 13 (GLiNER) |
| **Edges written** | **5** (clean, deduped) |
| **Relationship types** | **5 of 6** (AUTHORED, FIXES, REFERENCES, DEPENDS_ON, REVIEWED) |
| **Edge precision (vs gold)** | **100%** (5/5 correct) |
| **Latency** | **10.7–15.2s/doc** (E2B dominates) |
| **ASSOCIATED_WITH fallbacks** | **0** (entity-aware prompt eliminates) |

### Gold match (hybrid)

```
Document says:              Hybrid extracted:
PR-482 authored by bob    →  ✅ bob AUTHORED PR-482

Result: 5/5 correct (100% precision). Zero fallbacks.
```

### Key fix: E2B `<|channel>thought` leakage

E2B ignores `--reasoning-format none` and emits a `<|channel>thought`
reasoning block BEFORE the JSON. The parser was grabbing the FIRST
JSON array — which was an EXAMPLE inside the thinking block → 77 garbage
edges (e.g. `alice ASSOCIATED_WITH "checkout thread pool exhaustion"`).

**Fix in `hybrid_extraction._parse_and_validate()`:**
```python
# Strip E2B's <|channel|>thought reasoning block.
# Real JSON output appears AFTER the closing <|channel>| tag.
last_tag = cleaned.rfind("<|channel>|")
if last_tag != -1:
    cleaned = cleaned[last_tag + len("<|channel>|"):].strip()
# Then parse the LAST JSON array/object (final answer)
```

### Comparison: all 3 extraction modes

| Mode | Entities | Edges | **Extraction Precision** | Latency | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|--------------------------|----------|-------|
| `index_routing` (Qwen) | 9 (GLiNER) | ~5 | **~20%** | 1.2s | Too inaccurate |
| `llm` (E2B full-doc) | E2B decides | 9 | **89%** | 11.8s | 1 fallback edge |
| **`hybrid` (GLiNER+E2B)** | 13 (GLiNER) | **5** | **100%** | 10.7–15.2s | **Best extraction precision** |
| **`sliding_window` (our design; E2B backend)** | 13 (GLiNER) | **5 (short) / 15 (36K)** | **100% (short)** | 21s (short) / 63s (36K) | **Long-doc capable** |

**⚠️ Scope:** These numbers come from a **single 648-char test document** (`/tmp/prove_extraction.md`, PR-482 incident). They are a **micro-benchmark**, not corpus-scale. Extraction precision = % of extracted edges matching human gold standard on that one doc.

**Note:** "Extraction Precision" = correctness of entities+relations extracted **during ingestion** from a single test document. This is NOT the same as query-time retrieval/answer metrics (faithfulness, context_precision, context_recall) measured by the release gate.

**Verdict:** `hybrid` is the production recommendation for docs ≤4K tokens. `sliding_window` extends coverage to **any document length** (sentence-boundary chunking + coreference summaries) with the same 100% short-doc extraction precision. `llm` is the fallback; `index_routing` (Qwen) is deprecated (20%).

| **VRAM** | **5.4 GB** | 5.8 GB | close |
**Ruling:** **`hybrid` mode is the production default** (100% **extraction precision**, GLiNER+E2B, ≤4K tokens). `sliding_window` handles long docs (>4K). `llm` is the speed fallback (89% extraction precision). `index_routing` (Qwen) is deprecated (20% extraction precision). The 10× latency cost is acceptable — extraction runs once per document at ingest time, not at query time.

**Terminology clarification:**
- **Extraction precision** = correctness of entities+relations extracted **during ingestion** from source documents (measured on a single test doc in BENCHMARKS.md §1.1)
- **Query-time metrics** (measured by release gate): faithfulness (answer grounded in contexts), context_precision (retrieved chunks relevant to ground_truth), context_recall (ground_truth terms covered by contexts)
- These are **different metrics** — do not conflate them

### E2B llm Mode — Gold-Standard Match

Result: 8/9 edges correct (89% precision). The p99 latency spike from Stripe
was correctly attributed (IMPACTS). ADR-014 correctly linked to auth-service
(REFERENCES). The single ASSOCIATED_WITH fallback is the only error.
```

### Qwen Index-Routing — Gold-Standard Match
```
Document says:              Qwen extracted:
PR-482 fixes BUG-204    →  ❌ PR-482 FIXES checkout-publisher (wrong target)
PR-482 authored by bob  →  ❌ PR-482 AUTHORED checkout-publisher (wrong target)
bob authored PR-482     →  ✅ bob DEPENDS_ON checkout-publisher (wrong type, right entities)
                         →  ❌ BUG-204 AUTHORED checkout database (hallucination)
                         →  ❌ checkout DEPENDS_ON ADR-014 (garbage pair)

Result: ~1-2 of 5 edges correct (~20% precision). The 1.5B model
systematically confuses source/target and invents pairs.
```

## 1.1 WS3 — Sliding Window with Coreference (our design; E2B backend)

**Problem solved:** naive `text[pos:end]` character slicing split entity
names in half → GLiNER missed them, and coreference ("It depends on...")
had no referent across windows.

**Solution (measured 2026-07-12):**
- `spacy en_core_web_sm` sentence tokenization → chunks on COMPLETE sentences
- 2-sentence overlap (never splits an entity)
- Per chunk: GLiNER detects entities, E2B extracts with `PREVIOUS WINDOW
  SUMMARY` for coref resolution
- Summary generator (≤3 sentences) feeds next chunk

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Short doc (648 chars) | 5 edges, **100% precision** (matches hybrid) |
| Long doc (36,613 chars / ~9K tokens) | 15 edges, 5 types, **no truncation** |
| Entity names intact | ✅ No truncated names in any window |
| Latency (short) | 21s (GLiNER + E2B + summary) |
| Latency (long, 2 chunks) | 63s |

**Bug fixed during WS3:** E2B's huge `<\|channel\|>thought` block for
long chunks exhausts `max_tokens` (2048) before the final JSON. The
parser now harvests relations from the thinking block as a LAST-RESORT
(`_salvage_from_thinking`) → 15 edges recovered from 36K-char doc.

---

## 1.2 WS4 — Higher-Intelligence Model Test (Phi-3)

**Tested:** Phi-3-mini-4k Q4 in `llm` mode on `/tmp/prove_extraction.md`.

| Metric | Phi-3 | Qwen1.5B (prior) | E2B (hybrid) |
|--------|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Edges | 7 | ~5 | 5 |
| Precision | **23%** | 20% | **100%** |
| Latency | 7.1s | 1.2s | 10-15s |
| VRAM | 4.0 GB | 1.5 GB | 2.3 GB |

**Verdict:** Phi-3 (23%) and Qwen1.5B (20%) are BOTH worse than
Gemma-4-E2B (89-100%). The smaller models don't follow the strict
JSON schema — they confuse source/target and invent pairs. **E2B is the
correct extraction model.** No need to download Qwen2.5-3B/7B for the
primary path.

**WS4 conclusion:** Skip Qwen3B/7B download — E2B already wins.
The `index_routing` mode (Qwen) stays deprecated.

## 2. E2B LLAMA.CPP SERVER PERFORMANCE

### Current Flags
```
-m gemma-4-E2B-it-QAT-Q4_0.gguf  (QAT Q4_0, 3.3 GB on disk, ~2.3 GB VRAM loaded)
-c 4096  -t 12  -tb 12  --gpu-layers 999
--flash-attn on  --reasoning off  --parallel 2
--kv-unified  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8082  --no-warmup
```

### Server Log Metrics (from live extraction)
```
Prompt eval:   608.17 ms / 241 tokens  = 2.52 ms/token  (396 tok/s)
Generation:   8061.36 ms / 1040 tokens = 7.75 ms/token  (129 tok/s)
Total:        8669.54 ms / 1281 tokens
Graphs reused: 1034 (KV cache working)
```

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Prompt eval speed | **396 tok/s** | Good — E2B prompt is ~400 tokens |
| Generation speed | **129 tok/s** | Decent for Q4_0 9B on 3060 |
| KV cache reuse | **1034 graphs** | Cache working across calls |
| Context size | 4096 | May bottleneck long docs |
| VRAM (idle) | ~2.3 GB | Model weights only |
| Parallel slots | 2 | Doubles KV cache, not needed for serial ingest |

### Optimization Opportunities (see NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.md Workstream 2)
- `--parallel 1` saves ~256 MB VRAM
- `-c 8192` enables extraction of longer documents (+512 MB)
- Remove `--no-warmup` for consistent speed on first extraction
- `-b 1024 -ub 256` may reduce VRAM without slowing single-prompt extraction

## 3. RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE (hybrid vector + graph)

> **Measured 2026-07-14 on the live daemon** (RTX 3060 12 GB, populated
> `Engineering` graph — 82k Qdrant points + real entities/edges, companion
> `engineering_docs` also searched). These REPLACE the older 127 ms figure,
> which was an internal stage-sum micro-benchmark on a near-empty graph and
> excluded HTTP/serialization overhead and the companion path.

### 3.1 Internal stage timings (measured via direct function calls)

| Component | Latency | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Query embedding | **~125 ms** | Jina v3 (GPU) — realistic cold/warm, not the old 58 ms best-case |
| Primary Qdrant (`engineering_chunks`) | **~21 ms** | limit=10 |
| Companion Qdrant (`engineering_docs`) | **~19 ms** | runs in parallel with primary |
| Neo4j subgraph (keyword entry) | **~37–120 ms** | **index-backed** after TEXT indexes added (was ~250–300 ms) |
| Rerank (BGE) | **~1–5 ms** | over the merged candidate pool |

### 3.2 End-to-end `/ask` (synthesize:false) — REAL HTTP round-trip

| Query type | Latency (warm) | Breakdown |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Graph + primary (`who reported BUG-204?`) | **~1.05–1.3 s** | embed + Qdrant + Neo4j + HTTP/serialize |
| + companion (`total VRAM budget…`) | **~1.8–2.0 s** | above + companion Qdrant (parallel, +~0.1 s) |

The ~1 s of overhead beyond internal stages is **HTTP + FastAPI handler +
JSON serialization** of the returned contexts (the companion chunk text is
large). Synthesis (E4B, `synthesize:true`) adds generation time on top.

### 3.3 Optimization applied this session

The Neo4j subgraph was the dominant cost (~250–300 ms) because every `/ask`
did a full `:Entity` label scan (pulled up to 500 nodes + profiles, scored in
Python). Fixed by:
1. **Server-side token match** in `neo4j_subgraph` (Cypher `CONTAINS` on
   `id`/`name`, LIMIT 50) instead of the 500-node scan.
2. **TEXT indexes** `entity_name_idx` / `entity_id_idx` (created idempotently
   in the daemon `on_startup`) so the `CONTAINS` match is index-backed.
3. **Cached Neo4j driver** (process-long-lived) instead of reconnect-per-call.

Result: Neo4j subgraph **271 ms → 37 ms** (BUG-204), and `/ask` dropped from
~1.3 s → ~1.05 s (graph) / ~2.0 s → ~1.8 s (companion).

**Note:** the old "Full /ask hybrid retrieval = 127 ms" figure was an internal
stage sum (embed 58 + Qdrant 67 + Neo4j 82 + rerank 1) on a near-empty graph
with no companion and no HTTP overhead. It is NOT a real end-to-end latency.

## 4. VRAM BUDGET (measured, not estimated)

| Component | Model | VRAM (loaded) |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Jina v3 embed (fp16) | jina-embeddings-v3 | 3.9 GB |
| GLiNER | gliner_multi-v2.1 | 1.4 GB |
| E2B extraction (Q4_0) | gemma-4-E2B Q4_0 | 2.3 GB |
| **Total active** | | **7.6 GB** |
| **Measured (nvidia-smi)** | | **5.8 GB** (some sharing) |
| Headroom | | ~4.5-6.2 GB |

**Can fit alongside E2B (VRAM available for experiments):**
- Qwen2.5-3B Q4_K_M (~2.0 GB) — fits easily
- Qwen2.5-7B Q4_K_M (~4.7 GB) — fits (total ~10 GB, ~2 GB headroom)
- Qwen2.5-7B Q5_K_M (~5.5 GB) — too tight (~10.8 GB)
- Qwen2.5-14B any quant — over budget unless Jina/GLiNER unloaded

## 7. KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Systemd unit still points to Qwen** — sudo required to update. E2B running as user process (Option B flags documented in NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.md).
2. **`--no-warmup` active** — first extraction call slightly slower (~+1s) than subsequent.
3. **GLiNER double-prefixes ADR entities** ("ADR-ADR-014") — quirk in entity detection, not extraction. Relations still resolve correctly.
4. **E2B thinking block** — ignores `--reasoning-format none`, emits `<|channel|>thought`. Parser strips it (and harvests from it as fallback).
5. **`index_routing` mode deprecated** — Qwen1.5B = 20% precision. Use `hybrid` (100%) or `sliding_window` for long docs.
6. **Context 4096 → now 8192** — long-doc truncation SOLVED via sliding_window (sentence-boundary chunking).

## 8. v3.0.8 — Journal Domain (arxiv paper benchmark)

**Document:** arxiv 2401.18059 (RAPTOR: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval)  
**Size:** 77,775 characters, ~19K tokens, 14 pages  
**Domain:** `journal` (Person, Organization, Model, Dataset, Method, Algorithm, Institution, Author)

### 8.1 Bug-fix journey (real-time debugging, 2026-07-12)

| Attempt | What changed | Result |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1. Static labels (engineering vocab) | Journal domain with `entity_types: [Study, Method, ...]` | 0 entities matched — GLiNER can't recognize abstract types |
| 2. GLiNER-friendly labels | `entity_types: [Person, Organization, Model, ...]` | 69 entities but only 6 edges (3 noise: Cinderella/Prince) |
| 3. Raised `max_tokens: 2048→4096` | More room for JSON answer | NO CHANGE — still 6 edges |
| 4. **Chunk-size fix (ROOT CAUSE)** | `max_words: 3000→1400` (~4500→2000 tokens) | **65 edges, 7 relation types** |

**Root cause:** `max_words=3000` produced chunks of ~19K characters (~4500 tokens).
With E2B's 8192-token context, the `<|channel|>thought` block consumed the entire
budget, leaving 0 room for the JSON answer on 3 of 4 chunks. Only the smallest
chunk (15K chars) produced any relations.

### 8.2 Final result

| Metric | Before fix | After fix |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Entities detected | 69 | **138** |
| Edges written | 6 (3 noise) | **65** |
| Relation types | 5 | **7** (CITES, USES, EVALUATES, OUTPERFORMS, PROPOSES, REPORTS, SUPPORTS) |
| Ingest time | 89s | 323s |
| Chunks processed | 4 | 9–10 (smaller, more E2B calls) |

### 8.3 Production bug fixes (all found during journal testing)

| # | Bug | File | Fix |
|---|-----|------|-----|
| 1 | GLiNER field mismatch — sent `entity_types`, daemon expects `labels` | `hybrid_extraction.py:61` | Changed to `"labels": entity_types` |
| 2 | Qdrant 33MB upsert cap — 37MB single payload on long docs | `ingest.py:109` | Batched at 250 points/call |
| 3 | Sparse vector collision — duplicate indices from hash collision | `ingest.py:60-75` | Accumulate by index (sum tf) |
| 4 | YAML domain relation types not passed to E2B | `ingest.py:668-672` | Load domain dict when profile=None |
| 5 | Collection routing — journal docs to `engineering_chunks` | `ingest.py:587-590` | Route from domain's `collection:` field |

## 9. CURRENT BASELINE — `serve_gpu.py` v0.1.0 (2026-07-14)

**Hardware:** RTX 3060 12GB / i5-11400F / 48GB RAM / Ubuntu 22.04
**State:** populated `Engineering` graph (82k Qdrant points `engineering_chunks` +
real entities/edges in Neo4j) + companion `engineering_docs` (66 chunks).
**Measured:** live daemon, `synthesize:false`, warm, best-of-2 HTTP round-trip.

### 9.1 End-to-end `/ask` latency (synthesize:false)

| Query | Path | Latency |
|-------|------|---------|
| who reported BUG-204? | graph + primary (no companion hit) | **1.07 s** |
| how does Neo4j and Qdrant work together | companion (prose) | **1.25 s** |
| what database does ADR-021 use? | graph + primary | **1.30 s** |
| how does checkout relate to billing | graph + primary | **1.62 s** |
| total VRAM budget on RTX 3060 | companion + primary | **1.78 s** |

**Range: ~1.07–1.78 s.** Companion-path queries sit at the top
(~1.25–1.78 s); pure graph/primary queries at the bottom (~1.07–1.62 s).
With `synthesize:true`, E4B generation on `:8084` adds its own time on top
(earlier full-pipeline logs showed ~6.3 s for E4B); retrieval is unchanged.

### 9.2 Internal stage timings (direct function calls, same run)

| Component | Latency |
|-----------|---------|
| Query embedding (Jina v3, GPU) | ~125 ms |
| Primary Qdrant (`engineering_chunks`) | ~21 ms |
| Companion Qdrant (`engineering_docs`) | ~19 ms |
| Neo4j subgraph (index-backed) | ~37–120 ms |
| Rerank (BGE) | ~1–5 ms |
| **HTTP + FastAPI + JSON serialize** | **~0.7–1.0 s** |

Of the ~1.1–1.8 s total, only ~0.2–0.3 s is retrieval/rerank; the rest is
the HTTP round-trip + handler + serializing the returned contexts (the
companion chunk text is large).

### 9.3 vs legacy (corrected record)

The earlier "legacy never below 500ms" claim was **wrong** — it only applied
to the **CPU** daemon. The actual early (2026-07-10, v2.4.x) numbers:

| Path | Early (tiny graph, no companion) | **Now (v0.1.0, loaded)** |
|------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| GPU `/ask` retrieval | **~0.16 s** (below 500ms ✓) | **~1.07–1.78 s** |
| CPU `/ask` retrieval | **~3–5 s** (above 500ms ✓) | n/a (GPU-only now) |

- Early **GPU** `/ask` was ~160 ms — real, but measured on a near-empty graph
  (Neo4j subgraph ~6 ms, a handful of Qdrant points, **no companion**).
- Early **CPU** `/ask` was ~3–5 s — this is the "never below 500ms" case.
- Today is slower than early GPU because the graph is now real (82k points;
  Neo4j subgraph 6 ms → ~50 ms) and the companion path was added — but it
  remains ~2–3× faster than the early CPU path and far more capable (real
  graph + companion dual-evidence).
